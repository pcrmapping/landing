        <h1>Hello there!</h1>
        <p>You've reached the home of the <i>Princess Connect! Re:Dive</i> osu! mapping project.</p>
        <p>Right now, things are in a super early state so there's no fancy website or song list yet! Check back later if you'd like to see those things.</p>
        <p>If you'd like to get involved in the project, contact <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/u/6233296">tilda on osu!</a>.</p>

        <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/orgs/pcrmapping/projects/1">Current project goals before "release" are listed here!</a>
            If you're wanting to help with these goals, particularly if you have a good command of PHP/Laravel and Vue.js, please let me know!
        </p>
